# Hair Day Professional Services

Welcome to the Hair Day Professional Services project! This repository contains the source code for a comprehensive web application designed for a hair salon. It's a capstone project that I completed while pursuing my frontend web development course on Coursera.

This project is a simple landing page/home page for the salon.
